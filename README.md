These works are under **Prof. Akshay Joshi** , **Mechanical Engineering Department**, **IISc Bangalore**, on FNOs (Fourier Neural Networks) in multi-dimensions for material property analysis, in different circumstances.

## Fourier Neural Operators - based analysis
### Introduction
This repository provides an implementation and application of the Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), as introduced in the paper "Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations" by Zongyi Li et al. The FNO framework is a groundbreaking approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately. It leverages the power of Fourier transforms to learn mappings between function spaces, making it highly effective for problems where traditional numerical solvers may struggle with computational efficiency.
