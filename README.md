## Fourier Neural Operators - based analysis
### Introduction
This repository provides an implementation and application of the Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), as introduced in the paper "Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations" by Zongyi Li et al. The FNO framework is a groundbreaking approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately. It leverages the power of Fourier transforms to learn mappings between function spaces, making it highly effective for problems where traditional numerical solvers may struggle with computational efficiency.

### Focus
- Implementing the FNO Framework in multiple dimensions
- Applications for Time-Domain-Discretization Independent Predictions : Extending FNOs to predict time-evolving phenomena in a discretization-independent manner and avoiding the limitations of fixed time-step solvers.
- Material Signal Analysis : Using FNOs for predicting and analyzing signals and properties of materials. Insights into material behavior under different conditions using the learned mappings.
